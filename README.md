  MemoMap üó∫
</h1>

**MemoMap** is a travel diary product done with an interactive map interface. It allows a user to personally document the places he or she has been, set some preferences and save it by their individual Facebook account. Memomap is an app that tracks one's memories whilst encourage one to make more. This was a Makers Academy's final project.

<h2> How to Use: </h2>

We plan to deploy this App to Heroku, but until then you will need to follow these instructions in order to run MemoMap locally on your machine.

<h4> Install & Setup MongoDB: </h4>

If you don't already have MongoDB, follow the below steps.

In your command line:

```
  brew update

  brew install mongodb

  mkdir -p /data/db

  sudo chown -R `id -un` /data/db
  # Enter your password
```

<h4> Clone and setup Repo: </h4>

To setup the Repo on your local machine.

From your command line:

```
  git clone git@github.com:tmerrr/map-app.git

  cd map-app

  npm i

  mkdir public/uploads

  cd client

  npm i
```

<h4> Run App: </h4>

To run the app locally on your machine, you will need to open 3 terminals.

Terminal 1:

```
  mondgod
```

Terminal 2:

Change into project directory:

```
  cd <path>/map-app

  npm start
```

Terminal 3:

Change into the client folder of project directory:

```
  cd <path>/map-app/client

  npm start
```

<h4> Using the App </h4>

1. Click the 'Login with Facebook' button to sign in.
2. Use the roller on your mouse, or push up or pull down on your touchpad to zoom in and out.
3. Click and drag on the map to move around.
4. Use the search bar in the top right of the screen to search for a specific location.
5. To drop a Pin, enable the Pin Drop by clicking the 'Pin Drop: Off' button under the search bar. Then click on the map where you would like to place the Pin.
6. Click on the Pin and complete the form (all sections need to be completed) to upload a picture and create a Memory.
7. Click on the 'Hamburger' icon in the top left of the screen to open the sidebar. Here lists your details, information about the pins you've dropped, and your current traveler level.
8. To Logout, click the 'Logout' button in the sidebar.


<h2> Technologies:  </h2>

Our team decided to implement this product as a MERN stack. A MERN stack is a full on javascript built product, which uses the following
technologies ( Mongo, Express, React and Node )

| Front-End     | Back-End      | Testing |
| :---:         |:---:          | :---:   |
| React         | Node          | Jest    |
| Mapbox        | Express       | Mocha   |
|               | Mongo         | Chai    |

Our collective approach was to make sure that  "everyone was on the same page in terms of understanding the code. We had StandUps and Retros everyday to check in on what tasks needed to be
done for the day and to check in how everyone was
finding the progress of each day. We always wrote
down what we achieved today to reflect upon and decide what needed to be done tomorrow.

 To strengthen our understanding of our code overall, we also switched pairs everyday so that everyone got exposure and could explore the different sections of the code. We were successful with our goals as we all got exposure to dealing with the front-end, back-end and testing frameworks.


PS: Yes, R3TRO was a thing in our team.
